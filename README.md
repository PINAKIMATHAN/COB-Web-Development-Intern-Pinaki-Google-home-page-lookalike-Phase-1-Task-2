As an intern, I developed a countdown clock using Python, demonstrating my programming skills. This project involved handling time functions and user inputs to create a functional and interactive countdown experience. Through this task, I honed my problem-solving abilities and contributed to the team's projects with practical coding solutions as per the task of CodesOnBytes i.e., Web Development ----Phase-1-TASK-2.
